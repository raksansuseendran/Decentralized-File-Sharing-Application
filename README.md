# Decentralized-File-Sharing-Application
â€¢ Developed a smart contract-based decentralized application, enabling secure file uploading, sharing, and
downloading with integrated IPFS storage.

Problem Statement:
Current file sharing platforms face issues related to centralized control, data privacy, and
censorship. Centralized platforms are susceptible to data breaches, content manipulation,
and arbitrary censorship, eroding user trust and freedom of information exchange. To
address these challenges, there is a need for a decentralized alternative that ensures data
integrity, censorship resistance, and user autonomy.
Justification for Using Blockchain:
Blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, offers a decentralized and immutable ledger
that can serve as the foundation for a decentralized file sharing application. Here are key

Justifications for utilizing blockchain in this project:
1. Decentralization: Leveraging Ethereum's blockchain eliminates the need for a central
authority to manage the platform. Instead, it operates on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring
resilience against censorship and single points of failure.
2. Immutable Content: The blockchain's immutability ensures that once data is uploaded and
verified, it cannot be altered or tampered with, providing transparency and trust in the
authenticity of shared files.
3. Smart Contracts: Utilizing Solidity smart contracts allows for the automation of various
functions within the application, such as file uploading, downloading, and payment
processes. These contracts execute code in a trustless manner, removing the need for
intermediaries.
4. Censorship Resistance: Operating on a decentralized blockchain makes the platform
resistant to censorship attempts by any single entity. Users have control over their data and
interactions, fostering a more open and inclusive environment.
5. Transparency and Auditability: Every transaction and interaction on the platform is
recorded on the public blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability of the platform's
operations. Users can verify the integrity of the system and hold it accountable.
